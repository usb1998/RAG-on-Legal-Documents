    "The main objective of this assignment is to process and analyse a collection text files containing legal agreements (e.g., NDAs) to prepare them for implementing a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system. This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the Cleaned Data : Gain a comprehensive understanding of the structure, content, and context of the cleaned dataset.\n",
    "* Perform Exploratory Analysis : Conduct bivariate and multivariate analyses to uncover relationships and trends within the cleaned data.\n",
    "* Create Visualisations : Develop meaningful visualisations to support the analysis and make findings interpretable.\n",
    "* Derive Insights and Conclusions : Extract valuable insights from the cleaned data and provide clear, actionable conclusions.\n",
    "* Document the Process : Provide a detailed description of the data, its attributes, and the steps taken during the analysis for reproducibility and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal is to transform the raw text data into a clean, structured, and analysable format that can be effectively used to build and train a RAG system for tasks like information retrieval, question-answering, and knowledge extraction related to legal agreements."

    "### 4.1.1 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final RAG pipeline shows a significant enhancement in performance after iterative improvements across data preprocessing, chunking strategy, retrieval optimization, and answer extraction. The system achieved the following evaluation scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE-1: 0.2573\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE-2: 0.0418\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE-L: 0.1610\n",
    "\n",
    "BLEU: 0.0088\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics demonstrate a clear advancement over the initial baseline (ROUGE-1 ≈ 0.03), indicating that the optimized pipeline is able to reproduce more relevant legal clauses with better semantic and lexical overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insights Gained\n",
    "1. Data Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The legal documents contained long, highly structured clauses with dense terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial chunking methods often split clauses, resulting in incomplete retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting the chunk size to 600 characters with 150 overlap preserved clause integrity, which directly improved retrieval quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Pipeline Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching to MPNet embeddings dramatically strengthened the semantic retrieval stage by capturing clause-level meaning more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a stronger model such as FLAN-T5-Large improved the early generative attempts, but more importantly provided better representations during intermediate steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, generative models struggled to reproduce legal clauses verbatim.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. RAG Process Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrieval step had the highest impact on overall system performance.\n",
    "If the retriever fetched the correct clause, the system produced strong outputs; if not, scores dropped significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving from a generative RAG approach to an extractive RAG pipeline—using a cross-encoder reranker—led to major improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive answering ensured that answers were grounded directly in the source documents, reducing hallucination and increasing ROUGE overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-encoder reranker (MS-Marco) was particularly effective in ranking candidate sentences by relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Results Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L indicate that the system captures meaningful portions of the target clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low BLEU is expected because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Legal language requires near-exact reproduction,\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarks penalize paraphrasing heavily,\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive sentences still often differ slightly in phrasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The substantial jump in ROUGE metrics confirms that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval improved enough to consistently surface correct clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive selection aligned the final answer closely with the gold references\n"
